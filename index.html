              to all Concordia students We help students at all levels to learn
              and improve their tech skills. We organize workshops, events and
              competitions, and facilitate participation in external events. We
              help students in their careers through networking and job hunting
              events. All this we do in a fun and social atmosphere. Join us!

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <div id="mission-text">
            <h3>Help you learn new skills</h3>
            Through our tutorials, you’ll encounter tools and programming
            languages that you may never see in your classes, such as Git,
            Android and Python. These skills will help you tremendously when
            working on projects and looking for a job.

            <h3>Give you extra programming practice</h3>
            Aside from a few small assignments and projects, your classes won’t
            give you very much practical experience. During our weekly Algorithm
            Time event, you can challenge yourself with fun coding problems,
            some of which can potentially be given to you in a real job
            interview. You can also participate in awesome programming
            competitions like CS Games and IEEEXtreme, which are not only tons
            of fun but give you excellent coding practice.

            <h3>Help you in your job hunt</h3>
            Networking is extremely important when it comes to your future
            career. We host events like guest speakers and company tours, which
            will give you the opportunity to meet with representatives of
            different companies and build your network.

            <h3>Help you make new friends and have fun!</h3>
            We host a number of social events throughout the year, such as
            Lizard Lounge, Milk & Cookies, and Wine & Cheese. You’ll meet tons
            of really cool people and make your experience as a Concordia
            student worthwhile.
